##use incremental agile method 
###this is like start from little then add functions like




##(version 1)




##Students will fill form them then save into database 
##Studentdatabase info are like (name,email,phonenumber,major,passportnumber,and cvURLAdress)...and also another inputs from the form
##student db has unique email so email is the primary key
##job givers will seacrh based on this values from the database(like skills ,and major) then email them 
##if they want to download the cv also the will get the url from the database then download 
##if they get what they want they will email the student

##job givers will post job and save into db
## database info are like (name, email,jobdescription,wage per hour,skillsneeded).
##if somebody want to apply they fill form

###the question is now do I need user accounts????????? Yes maybe on the first version only for job givers
####maybe we can use some kind of api like wechat api, or google api for user account or just use account 
####so job givers should have a user account but students won't 
####after posting jobs 

###so the user account will have user name and password and will be stored in a database
###so now jobs will have a (givername,and content) 
###and if someone wants to apply for the job he will press the button and save the data in the database then
###the job giver can see applier's detail when he log's in then if he or she meets the requirment they will send an email for them.
####database will save (givername,applier'sname,and other things).




##student can search jobs using different inputs like (skill or wage per hour)
##both can't directly post after they fill the form they will be approved by admin beacuse they can post trash things 




##version 2(includes user account)

##everybody will have user account
